Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Python.  This is a Regression Machine Learning Project.
To predict the car price with given given features 
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

name
year
selling_price
km_driven
fuel
seller_type
transmission
Owner
we are using Linear Regression model to predict the car price predection 
we have 301 rows and 9 columns 
we divided the data in to X and Y 
Encoding the Categorical Data in to 0 and 1 
divided the data in to train and test data
create a model with LInear Regression 
model evaluation done with mean square error 
Visualize the actual prices and Predicted prices
